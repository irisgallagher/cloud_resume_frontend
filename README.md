The frontend was built using HTML and CSS to create a responsive and visually appealing resume. It was hosted in an S3 bucket configured for static website hosting, ensuring scalability and reliability. CloudFront was used as a content delivery network (CDN) to cache and distribute the site globally, reducing latency. While developing the frontend, debugging challenges like broken links and formatting issues were addressed by referencing resources such as Stack Overflow and W3Schools. Testing involved clearing browser caches and manually invalidating CloudFront caches to verify updates. Accessibility and usability improvements were also considered, such as ensuring links opened in new tabs using the target="_blank" attribute. This process highlighted the importance of iterative testing and debugging to achieve a polished final product.
